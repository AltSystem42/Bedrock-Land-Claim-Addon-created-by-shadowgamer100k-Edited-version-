# Bedrock-Land-Claim-Addon-created-by-shadowgamer100k-Edited-version-
Bedrock Land Claim Addon created by shadowgamer100k (Edited version) works with 1.21.60 with beta-apis enabled.
This only contains the Behavior Pack. 

NO RESOURCE PACK. GO TO CREATORS YOUTUBE AND DOWNLOAD IT THROUGH THEIR LINKS TO GIVE THEM SUPPORT!
I made add it in if I get certian complaints about their links.
